2015 Zeng, Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction via Piecewise Convolutional Neural Networks

	Hypothesis: automatically learning features using PCNNs with multi-instance learning can lead to an increase in performance

	Goal: Solve two problems arise when using distant supervision for relation extraction (
		1. heuristic alignment can fail, resulting in wrong label problem.
		2. The noise that originates from the feature extraction process can cause poor performance.).

	Author :  propose a novel model dubbed the Piecewise Convolu- tional Neural Networks (PCNNs) with
	multi-instance learning to address these two problems.

	Comment 01: PCNNs are proposed for the automatic learning of features without complicated NLP preprocessing
============================================================
2015 Xu, Semantic Relation Classification via Convolutional Neural Networks with Simple Negative Sampling

	Author:  propose to learn more robust relation representations from the shortest dependency path through a convolution neural network.

	Comment 01: the paper appear to be with no enought details.

2015 Nguyen, Relation Extraction-Perspective from Convolutional Neural Networks

	Author:  introducing a convolutional neural network for relation extraction that automatically learns features
			 from sen tences and minimizes the dependence on external toolkits and resources.

	Comment 01: focuses on the relation extraction task with an unbalanced corpus
	Comment 02: * Author say that there is no work  on employing CNNs for relation extraction so far. 
        	                         and it is the first work *
	Comment 03: I saw some similar in (2015 Zeng)

Portuguese
2013 Batista, Extracçao de Relaçoes Semânticas de Textos em Português Explorando a DBpédia e a Wikipédia
>> English:" Exploring DBpedia and Wikipedia for Portuguese Semantic Relationship Extraction"

	Author:  discusses an approach for distantly supervised relation extraction over texts written in the Portuguese
		language, which uses an efficient technique for measuring similarity between relation instances, based on
		minwise hashing (Broder, 1997) and on locality sensitive hashing (Rajaraman e Ullman, 2011).
